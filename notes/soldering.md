# Soldering Notes

## Solder

- **Recommended:** 0.031" (0.8mm) rosin core 60/40 tin/lead — easiest to work with
- **Lead-free alternative:** 0.031" SAC305 — needs higher temp, less forgiving

## Temperature

| Solder Type | Melting Point | Iron Temp |
|---|---|---|
| 60/40 leaded | 183°C | ~320°C (608°F) |
| SAC305 lead-free | ~220°C | 350-380°C (660-715°F) |

- Start at 360°C for lead-free, adjust up if joints look dull/blobby
- Use a chisel tip for better heat transfer
- Extra flux paste helps with lead-free
- Don't linger — higher temps damage components faster
- Wash hands after using leaded solder

## Skills Needed for Iris

- Strip and tin wire ends
- Wire-to-wire splice joints
- Solder cut USB cable to Maestro power terminals
- Heat shrink tubing for clean joints

## Practice Projects

### Beginner (wire work)
- Strip and tin wire ends
- Wire-to-wire splice joints
- Cut a USB cable and solder to screw terminals
- Solder headers onto a breadboard breakout

### Beginner kits (~$5-15)
- LED flashlight kits
- AM/FM radio kits
- Velleman or Elenco beginner kits
- Search "learn to solder kit" on Amazon

### Intermediate
- Solder headers onto an Arduino or Raspberry Pi Pico
- Build a small circuit on perfboard (LED + resistor + button)
- Practice desoldering and rework

### Fun builds
- Electronic dice kit
- 555 timer blinker circuit
- USB-powered LED lamp
- Mechanical keyboard kit (lots of repetitive through-hole practice)
